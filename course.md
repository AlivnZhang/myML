# Courses I have taken

There're some courses that might be old(dated to 2012), or new(2018), but my take is that they should be
in high quality(here I meant: good review, from prestigious universities or companies).

Someone might argue it's less efficient to learn by watching lecture videos, comparing to learning from reading
books. That is true for most cases, esp. when you have a strong and solid background. Lectures tend to get things more
detailed and easy to understand, while books are more concise and sometimes you cannot see the steps in between.
So it might make more sense if you don't have a solid background, or you might want to get the point(intuition) in a more
casual way instead of the concise formal way.

Information theory is great when describing the uncertainty of the world, and it provides the solid mathematical bedrock
for machine learning.
