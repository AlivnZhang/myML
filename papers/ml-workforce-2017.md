## What can machine learning do? Workforce implications

This is not a normal ML paper, but a paper focusing on the workforce the ML might bring in, i.e in the 
economic perspective.


### 要点

1. technological advances have contributed to wage inequality is strong
2. philosopher Polanyi observed, we know more than we can tell 
3. SML(Suitable ML) tasks 
	* Learning a function that maps well-defined inputs to well-defined outputs
	* Large (digital) data sets exist or can be created containing input-output pairs
	* The task provides clear feedback with clearly definable goals and metrics
	* No long chains of logic or reasoning that depend on diverse background knowledge or common sense
	* No need for detailed explanation of how the decision was made
	* A tolerance for error and no need for provably correct or optimal solutions
	* The phenomenon or function being learned should not change rapidly over time
	* No specialized dexterity, physical skills, or mobility required
4. on workforce
	* generative design: the final goal can be well specified and the solutions can be automatically evaluated as clearly right or wrong, or at least better or worse
5. six economic factors
	* substitution
	* price elasticity
	* complementarities
	* income elasticity
	* elasticity of labor supply
	* business process redesign


### 个人点评

1. 技术进步会增加收入的不平等，这就像地球是平的作者指出的一样，可替代性或许是收入的直接因素，而科技的进步
   显然会增加技术掌握的鸿沟（少部分人掌握顶端的技术，大部分人都流入底层的技术，而中间的技术很多会被自动化）,
   进而影响工作的可替代性和收入的分配
2. 当然作者也提到了需要一定的时间、并非所有的行业都适合ML、会创造新的职业等，但职业受影响的人总是会受到伤害的，
   哪怕只是暂时的，而职业的迁移过程也是痛苦的

抽空读一篇非技术的文章，轻松了太多 😀
